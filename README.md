# Productivity-app
This productivity-app is built by using HTML, CSS and JS codes only. It enables the user to save daily tasks with their appropriate date and time. Since it stores the tasks in the local storage of the browser, users don't lose their tasks when the browser refreshes. Also it notify the users before the task due date reaches.
